# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a standardized AI collaboration framework for the "懶得變有錢" project to ensure code quality, clear version history, and efficient team communication in a multi-AI agent environment. The system will establish development standards, Git workflows, code quality tools, and AI coordination protocols that all team members (both human and AI) must follow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want standardized Git commit message formats, so that version history is clear and trackable across all contributors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any team member commits code THEN the system SHALL enforce Conventional Commits standard format
2. WHEN a commit message is created THEN it SHALL follow the format `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
3. WHEN branch names are created THEN they SHALL follow the format `<type>/<short-description>`
4. IF a commit message doesn't follow the standard THEN the system SHALL reject the commit

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated code formatting and quality checks, so that all code maintains consistent style and quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is saved or committed THEN Prettier SHALL automatically format the code
2. WHEN code is committed THEN linting tools (markdownlint, stylelint, eslint) SHALL validate code quality
3. WHEN linting errors are found THEN the system SHALL prevent the commit until issues are resolved
4. WHEN code formatting is applied THEN it SHALL be consistent across all file types

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want standardized documentation structure, so that project information is consistently organized and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN README.md is created or updated THEN it SHALL follow the standardized structure template
2. WHEN code comments are written THEN they SHALL explain "Why" rather than "What"
3. WHEN documentation is updated THEN it SHALL maintain consistency with the established format
4. IF documentation structure is incomplete THEN the system SHALL provide guidance for completion

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want a hierarchical prompt system with clear protocols, so that I can collaborate effectively while maintaining security and role clarity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI protocols are established THEN they SHALL be stored in a separate private repository
2. WHEN core AI protocols are defined THEN they SHALL be in a unified `AI_PROTOCOL.md` file
3. WHEN individual AI configurations are created THEN they SHALL not conflict with core protocols
4. WHEN AI role assignments are made THEN they SHALL follow the flexible assignment model
5. IF private repository access is needed THEN it SHALL maintain absolute separation from public code

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want automated setup and validation tools, so that the collaboration standards can be easily implemented and maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is set up THEN it SHALL automatically configure all required tools (Prettier, linters)
2. WHEN validation is run THEN it SHALL check compliance with all established standards
3. WHEN setup scripts are executed THEN they SHALL provide clear feedback on success or failure
4. WHEN configuration files are missing THEN the system SHALL create them with appropriate defaults
5. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance for fixing issues
