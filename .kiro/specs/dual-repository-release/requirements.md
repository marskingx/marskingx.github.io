# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a coordinated release system for managing version synchronization between a public code repository and a private configuration repository. The system ensures that when a new version is released, both repositories receive identical version tags, creating precise version correspondence while maintaining absolute separation between public and private data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want automated version synchronization between public and private repositories, so that I can maintain precise version correspondence without manual coordination.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a release is initiated THEN the system SHALL create identical version tags on both repositories
2. WHEN version tags are created THEN they SHALL follow semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
3. WHEN the release process completes THEN both repositories SHALL have the same version tag pushed to their remotes
4. IF either repository fails to receive the tag THEN the system SHALL provide clear recovery instructions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple npm command interface for releases, so that complex cross-repository operations are abstracted into easy-to-use commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `npm run release` is executed THEN it SHALL start an interactive release process
2. WHEN `npm run memory:push` is executed THEN it SHALL commit and push changes to the private repository
3. WHEN `npm run memory:pull` is executed THEN it SHALL pull latest changes from the private repository
4. WHEN any command fails THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery steps

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want configurable repository paths, so that the system can work with different local directory structures without hardcoded paths.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL read private repository path from configuration files
2. WHEN configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL prompt for setup or use environment variables
3. WHEN repository paths are invalid THEN the system SHALL validate and report specific errors
4. IF configuration changes THEN the system SHALL validate new paths before proceeding

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want atomic release operations, so that partial failures don't leave repositories in inconsistent states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a release operation fails THEN the system SHALL not leave repositories in partially updated states
2. WHEN pre-release validation fails THEN the system SHALL abort before making any changes
3. WHEN the public repository is updated successfully but private repository fails THEN the system SHALL provide rollback instructions
4. WHEN Git working directories are dirty THEN the system SHALL require clean state before proceeding

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want comprehensive logging and feedback during release operations, so that I can monitor progress and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN release operations execute THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step progress feedback
2. WHEN operations complete successfully THEN the system SHALL confirm all actions taken
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with context
4. WHEN validation checks run THEN the system SHALL report the status of each check
5. IF manual intervention is needed THEN the system SHALL provide specific instructions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want interactive version selection, so that I can choose the appropriate version increment type for each release.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the release process starts THEN the system SHALL prompt for version increment type (major, minor, patch)
2. WHEN version type is selected THEN the system SHALL show the current and new version numbers
3. WHEN version confirmation is requested THEN the system SHALL allow the user to confirm or cancel
4. IF the user cancels THEN the system SHALL exit cleanly without making changes
